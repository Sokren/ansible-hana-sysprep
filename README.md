```

Here is a short Howto on running this playbook from commandline

1. Configure your inventory with your servers (default: /etc/ansible/hosts), e.g.
```
   [...]

   [hana-servers]
   10.32.111.3 ansible_user=ansible-remote

   [...]
```
  ansible_user defines a specific username to use for the ssh connection 

2. Make sure your ansible connection to the target host is working:
```
$ ansible -m setup [-k connection_user password ] [-K root password]
10.32.111.3 | SUCCESS => {
"ansible_facts": {
     [...]
       }, 
    "changed": false
}

```
See "man ansible" for password options. You could also use ssh-keys and sudo without password

3. If your connection works you can kick-off the playbook
$ ansible-playbook -vvv  -b -e @examples/var.yaml hana_prep.yaml

  -vvv enables debugging output
  -b : switches execution to root
  -e @examples/var.yaml points to the file with the defined variables
  hana_prep.yaml: Playbook that defines the actual role

 
### TODO ###
- Check /etc/hosts for HANA compliance and correct
- act depending on HANA versions (different required libraries)
